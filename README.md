# Leave of Absence Request Form Automation

I worked on this project during my time at WMU Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine. I was requested to create a flow that automated the process of filling out a leave of absence request form, which previously required tedious downloading, emailing, and printing. My automation capitalizes on efficiency and allows everyone involved an easy-going process to complete any leave of absence request.

This flow showcases how to use Power Automate to capture Microsoft Form responses, signatures, dates and comments (using approvals) to populate the document.

This project took advantage of the following technologies: Microsoft Forms, Word, SharePoint, and Power Automate as well as the diagrams.net application to create a visual workflow.
