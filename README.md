# Leave of Absence Request Form Automation

This is a projected I worked on during my time at WMU Homer Styker.

I was requested to create a flow that automated the process of filling out a leave of absence request form.

This project takes advantage of the following technologies: Microsoft Forms, Word, Sharepoint, and Power Automate 
as well as the diagrams.net application to create a visual workflow.

This flow showcases how to use Power Automate to capture Microsoft Form responses, signatures,
dates and comments (using approvals) to populate the leave of absence request form document.

To open the drawio diagram, fork the file onto your GitHub account, visit https://app.diagrams.net/, and open the file from GitHub.
